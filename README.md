<!-- TECHNOLOGY STACK -->
## Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies:

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications.

- **React Router:** A library for managing routing and navigation in React applications, making it easy to create single-page applications.

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early and improve code quality.

- **ESLint:** A tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code, ensuring code consistency and best practices.

- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that automatically formats your code to follow a consistent style.

- **Husky:** A tool that helps enforce code quality and standards by running scripts (e.g., linting) before commits are made.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you can run a project locally. Follow these simple steps as an example.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AlxndrSmk/React-Components.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
```
   npm run build
```
The application will be launched in development mode and can be accessed at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).


### Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Husky is also configured to run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Before committing changes, the pre-commit hooks will automatically format the code using Prettier and check for linting errors using ESLint.

To format the code using Prettier manually, use the following command:
```
   npm run format
```
To run ESLint for TypeScript and TSX files, use the following command:
```
   npm run lint
```


### Building the Project

To create an optimized production build of the project, use the following command:
```
   npm run build
```

## Preview

Before running the preview, make sure you have a production build ready by running the `npm run build` command.

To preview the build and see how the application works in production mode, use the following command:
```
   npm run preview
```

## Available Commands
There are also other useful commands in the application available

- `npm run format:fix`: To automatically fix Prettier formatting for TypeScript, TSX, SCSS and JSON files.
- `npm run lint:fix`: To automatically fix ESLint errors for TypeScript and TSX files inside /src folder.

And remember...
You should ‚öîÔ∏è fight evil, not ü§ù join it!
